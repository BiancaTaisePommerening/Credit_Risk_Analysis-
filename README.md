-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this deliverable, youâ€™ll write a brief summary and analysis of the performance of all the machine learning models used in this Challenge.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
