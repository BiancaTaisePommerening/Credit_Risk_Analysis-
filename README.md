# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Supervised Machine Learning


## Analysis Overview

Perform credit risk analysis using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate Supervised Machine learning Models using resampling techniques where models with unbalanced classes are trained and evaluated, in order to write a recommendation on whether any of them should be used to predict credit risk.


Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, to oversample the data using the following machine learning models and their algoriths:
- Oversampling Model
    - RandomOverSampler Algorithm
    - SMOTE Algorithm
- Undersampling Model:
    - ClusterCentroids Algorithm
- Combination Over- and Undersampling Model
    - SMOTEEN Algorithm
- Reducing Bias Models:
    - BalancedRandomForestClassifier
    - EasyEnsembleClassifier

For this deliverable, youâ€™ll write a brief summary and analysis of the performance of all the machine learning models used in this Challenge.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
